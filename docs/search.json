Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6436861\n            \n            \n            Julie Jung is an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow based\n            at the University of Utah studying developmental plasticity\n            in extremophile Diplogastrid nematodes. As a postdoc in\n            molecular biology, Julie admittedly spends the majority of\n            her time contentedly pushing around small sterile volumes of\n            liquid (she’s somewhat sheepish to say she has a favorite\n            pipette now). But studying plasticity in several systems\n            gives her a chance to do something new pretty much every\n            day, like grow plants or trap voles or kayak around the\n            Great Salt Lake collecting worms.\n            Julie spent her Ph.D. chasing frogs conducting fieldwork\n            at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Gamboa,\n            Panama where she examined vibration-cued early hatching\n            behavior (plasticity!) in Agalychnis callidryas (red-eyed\n            treefrogs). Working outdoors in sweaty, soggy, buggy, humid,\n            normally deplorable conditions makes her really happy.\n            Julie got her B.A. from Williams College in 2015 and her\n            dual M.A./Ph.D. from Boston University in 2021. She is\n            basically in the 23rd (24th?) grade, but she’s sort of\n            losing count at this point. See her CV for more academic\n            information. Julie is a 1st generation college graduate and\n            a 1st generation US citizen. She credits everything good in\n            her life to her loving parents, who rededicated and\n            rearranged their entire lives to facilitate the success of\n            their children.\n            Julie spends almost all her free time doodling or doing\n            typical Utah things like biking, skiing, and climbing rock\n            & ice. If you’re in need of a graphic designer or an\n            outdoorsing partner, here’s how to contact her:\n            \n            I’m a Master student in Statistical Science at Ghent\n            University, a PhD candidate in Organizational Behavior at\n            the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and an Affiliate\n            at the Stanford Data Science Center for Open and\n            Reproducible Science (SDS-CORES). I’m interested in\n            Organizational Behavior, with a special interest in Groups\n            and Teams and Leadership. In addition to my substantive work\n            in Organizational Behavior, I’m interested in meta-science\n            and methods. In my free time, I enjoy deadlifting, hiking,\n            and taking board games much too seriously.\n            I’m always looking for ways to contribute to large-scale\n            efforts that aim to improve the rigor and reproducibility of\n            (behavioral) science. For example, I’m a Project Manager of\n            the Replications & Reversals project at FORRT (Framework\n            for Open and Reproducible Research Training); I’m an\n            ex-officio member of the Executive Board of SIPS (The\n            Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science); and\n            I’m a Team Lead at the NASA TOPS (Transform to Open Science)\n            Mission, where I lead a team of subject-matter experts in\n            developing a curriculum on Open Science Tools and Resources.\n            I’m also actively involved with the Center for Open Science\n            DARPA-SCORE project as a Reproduction and Replication\n            Analyst and Auditor.\n            My favorite letter in the alphabet is R, and I am weirdly\n            evangelical about it. I co-teach Data & Decisions — a\n            graduate-level, introductory class on probability and\n            statistics using — and I’m a co-organizer of the Stanford\n            Data Science for Social Good program.

Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6436861\n              \n              \n              Julie Jung is an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow based\n              at the University of Utah studying developmental\n              plasticity in extremophile Diplogastrid nematodes. As a\n              postdoc in molecular biology, Julie admittedly spends the\n              majority of her time contentedly pushing around small\n              sterile volumes of liquid (she’s somewhat sheepish to say\n              she has a favorite pipette now). But studying plasticity\n              in several systems gives her a chance to do something new\n              pretty much every day, like grow plants or trap voles or\n              kayak around the Great Salt Lake collecting worms.\n              Julie spent her Ph.D. chasing frogs conducting\n              fieldwork at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute\n              in Gamboa, Panama where she examined vibration-cued early\n              hatching behavior (plasticity!) in Agalychnis callidryas\n              (red-eyed treefrogs). Working outdoors in sweaty, soggy,\n              buggy, humid, normally deplorable conditions makes her\n              really happy.\n              Julie got her B.A. from Williams College in 2015 and\n              her dual M.A./Ph.D. from Boston University in 2021. She is\n              basically in the 23rd (24th?) grade, but she’s sort of\n              losing count at this point. See her CV for more academic\n              information. Julie is a 1st generation college graduate\n              and a 1st generation US citizen. She credits everything\n              good in her life to her loving parents, who rededicated\n              and rearranged their entire lives to facilitate the\n              success of their children.\n              Julie spends almost all her free time doodling or doing\n              typical Utah things like biking, skiing, and climbing rock\n              & ice. If you’re in need of a graphic designer or an\n              outdoorsing partner, here’s how to contact her:\n              \n              I’m a Master student in Statistical Science at Ghent\n              University, a PhD candidate in Organizational Behavior at\n              the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and an Affiliate\n              at the Stanford Data Science Center for Open and\n              Reproducible Science (SDS-CORES). I’m interested in\n              Organizational Behavior, with a special interest in Groups\n              and Teams and Leadership. In addition to my substantive\n              work in Organizational Behavior, I’m interested in\n              meta-science and methods. In my free time, I enjoy\n              deadlifting, hiking, and taking board games much too\n              seriously.\n              I’m always looking for ways to contribute to\n              large-scale efforts that aim to improve the rigor and\n              reproducibility of (behavioral) science. For example, I’m\n              a Project Manager of the Replications & Reversals\n              project at FORRT (Framework for Open and Reproducible\n              Research Training); I’m an ex-officio member of the\n              Executive Board of SIPS (The Society for the Improvement\n              of Psychological Science); and I’m a Team Lead at the NASA\n              TOPS (Transform to Open Science) Mission, where I lead a\n              team of subject-matter experts in developing a curriculum\n              on Open Science Tools and Resources. I’m also actively\n              involved with the Center for Open Science DARPA-SCORE\n              project as a Reproduction and Replication Analyst and\n              Auditor.\n              My favorite letter in the alphabet is R, and I am\n              weirdly evangelical about it. I co-teach Data &\n              Decisions — a graduate-level, introductory class on\n              probability and statistics using — and I’m a co-organizer\n              of the Stanford Data Science for Social Good program.
