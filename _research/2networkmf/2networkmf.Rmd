## Abstract

In this study, we analyze the information content of active mutual fund holdings using a network model. By analyzing 48 million of fund network connections, we document two main findings: First, we find a strong association between portfolio distinctiveness and its long-term risk-adjusted return. We measure funds’ distinctiveness in two dimensions: centrality and clusteredness. The centrality measures the overall commonness of a fund’s portfolio, while clusteredness measures how strongly a fund is forming a clique (localized strategy).We find funds that hold assets commonly held by others (high centrality) underperform by 60bps, while funds with localized and distinctive portfolio (high clusteredness) outperform 140 bps in a year. Second, we find effect of peer competition that monotonically harms the fund’s performance. Funds that are located in lowest quintile of competition outperforms 240bps in a year compared to top quintile funds. All results hold significance for more than 24 months. Our network-based approach overcomes potential confounding effects from style misclassifications and mixed-style funds.
