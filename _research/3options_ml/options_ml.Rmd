### Abstract

U.S. stock exchanges have closing auctions that generate robust benchmark closing prices; however, options markets do not have closing auctions. Exchanges and brokerages use mid-quote at close, and funds use the last trade as the benchmark price. The closing quotes are noisy because the options trading near the market close is very volatile. In this study, we estimate a more robust and efficient closing option price using the closing stock price with a machine learning model. We consider several machine learning algorithms: Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Extreme gradient boosting, Random forest, Deep learning, and Elastic net. We obtain a reliable option price estimator by combining Black-Scholes option prices and a machine learning algorithm (GBM), with an out-of-sample r-squared of 99.8%. We test the reliability of our estimate and analyze the price discrepancy between the 4 pm mid-quote and our estimates. Unlike stocks, 75% of estimated optionsâ€™ closing prices lie within the bid-ask spread, likely due to the wide option spreads at the close. We find that the price deviation of the ML estimate and mid-quote at the close is particularly large for 1) large firms, 2) out-of-the-money options, and 3) short expiration options. Formal regression tests show consistent results that options actively traded and with larger spreads exhibit greater deviations. Our results shed light on the validity of using the end-of-day mid-quote as a benchmark option price.
