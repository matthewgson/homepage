## Welcome!

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Finance at the University of Florida, and expected to finish the program in 2023. I'm on the job market this year. My research interest includes Big data/Maching Learning in Finance, FinTech, Derivative securities, Market microstructure and Mutual funds. I'll be presenting my paper at the FMA Doctoral, FMA Asia and Global Conference. 

I was a recipient of [**Ph.D Excellence in Teaching Award**](https://news.warrington.ufl.edu/students/three-finance-and-accounting-phd-students-honored-with-teaching-awards/) at Warrington College of Business.
I taught *Financial Modeling* course at that introduces various modern technologies including object-oriented programming, automation techniques and machine learning.  I value mentoring relationships with my former students and look forward to many more.
